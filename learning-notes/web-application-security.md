# Web Application Security

This document contains my learning notes and understanding of web application security concepts as part of my cybersecurity training and internship preparation.

## Web Application Basics
- A web application is software that runs on a web server and is accessed through a browser.
- It follows a client–server architecture where the client sends requests and the server processes them.

## Importance of Web Application Security
- Web applications handle sensitive user data such as login credentials and personal information.
- Poor security can lead to data breaches, unauthorized access, and financial loss.

## OWASP Top 10 (Learning Focus)
The following OWASP vulnerabilities have been studied as part of my learning:
- SQL Injection
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Broken Authentication
- Insecure Design
- Security Misconfiguration

## Learning Approach
- Studying industry-standard security guidelines (OWASP)
- Understanding vulnerabilities through real-life examples
- Preparing for hands-on testing in real-time projects
